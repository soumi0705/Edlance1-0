**The problem Edlαnce solves :** \
Field of Interest :\
EdTech: Help the field of education move from the dark ages to the golden age of technology.
Blockchain: Bring change to transactions and cryptocurrency with promising Blockchain solutions.

### Problem Statement:
* Education sector was one of the worst hit, due to lockdowns, 0 physical classes, reduced student-teacher interaction, and less to no Doubt Clearing sessions.
* A lot of Educators lost their employment. Taking classes all day through a Wi-Fi connection also takes a toll on their pockets.
* Gamification concept must be implemented for better learning and keeping students engaged.
* Students in these times also feel like to contribute to their pocket money themselves.


### Proposed System:
* A blockchain solution, connecting students to freelance educators whose livelihoods are impacted in the pandemic. 
* Application of a trending education technique "Education by Gamification" (Peer answering resulting in real monetary rewards).
* Bounty system in which each question will have some mEth put in as bounty and can be redeemed be giving an answer within a constrained time period.
* Peer answer should be verified by Expert before unlocking of funds for better user experience.
* Additional Disscussions Panel for Peer-Peer communication, sharing of knowledge.

### Benefits:
* Verified Educators can earn their livelihoods easily at the comfort of their house.
* Motivates students to excel even more in their field of interest. Helps even student earn in cryptocurrency and add to the pocket money
* With the bounty system we believe that much tougher questions can be asked through the portal and will attract many people to answer. 
* Urgency of getting a question solved, higher the need of answer higher the bounty you can keep.
* All procedures of payment and dispute resolution will follow the Law of Code set by our Edlance Smart Contract, making it completely transparent to public.


### Future Plans :
1. Upvote/downvote (for peer answers)
2. Auto upgrade account to Student Pro (calculation Based on their Peer answers)
3. Paid Discussion panel (with Experts)
4. Additional knowledge sharing section (off-Topic)

# Node.js getting started application
The Getting Started tutorial for Node.js uses this sample application to provide you with a sample workflow for working with any Node.js app on IBM Cloud or in IBM Cloud Private; you set up a development environment, deploy an app locally and on the cloud, and then integrate a IBM Cloud database service in your app.

The Node.js app uses [Express Framework](https://expressjs.com) and [Cloudant noSQL DB service](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/cloudant-nosql-db) or the [MongoDB Service](http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/) to add information to a database and then return information from a database to the UI. To learn more about how the app connects to Cloudant, see the [Cloudant library for Node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cloudant).

  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM-Cloud/get-started-java/master/docs/GettingStarted.gif" width="300" alt="Gif of the sample app contains a title that says, Welcome, a prompt asking the user to enter their name, and a list of the database contents which are the names Joe, Jane, and Bob. The user enters the name, Mary and the screen refreshes to display, Hello, Mary, I've added you to the database. The database contents listed are now Mary, Joe, Jane, and Bob.">
</p>

## Before you begin

You'll need a [IBM Cloud account](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [Cloud Foundry CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli#downloads), and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. If you use [IBM Cloud Private](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/products/ibm-cloud-private/), you need access to the [IBM Cloud Private Cloud Foundry](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSBS6K_2.1.0/cloud_foundry/overview.html) environment.

## Instructions

**IBM Cloud Cloud Foundry**: [Getting started tutorial for Node.js](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-foundry-public?topic=cloud-foundry-public-getting-started-node).

**IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service**: [Deploy to IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](README-kubernetes.md)

**Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud**: [Deploy to Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud](README-OpenShift.md)

**IBM Cloud Private**: The starter application for IBM Cloud Private guides you through a similar process. However, instead of hosting both your service and application in the same cloud environment, you use a user-provided service. This guide shows you how to deploy your application to IBM Cloud Private and bind it to a Cloudant Database in IBM Cloud. For the complete procedure, see [Working with user-provided services and the Node.js starter app](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBS6K_2.1.0/cloud_foundry/buildpacks/buildpacks_using_nodejsapp.html).
